The great debate - Processes or Threads? On the Client? On the Server?

We will use BSD Sockets not QT Sockets

==To Do This Week==
  # message class
  # prototypes BSD client/server stuff
  # tiny high level calls
  # basic call order
  # internal CRC
  # create serializable base class
    * add getbytes() to transmittable classes
    * add constructor that takes a byte stream to transmittable classes
