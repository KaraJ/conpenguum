Game engine

Because the game engine is so procedural we decided to
show some (very) high level steps instead of a diagram.

The steps below are meant to show interactions between the
various segments in the engine and the order in which things
will be executed.
{{{
init graphics
init physics
call menu
init input capture
connect client to server

Start game loop
	receive input
	send input data to server
	server replies with graphics/physics change
	update UI/graphics
	
	if player exits
		break game loop
	
disconnect client from server
call menu
exit or start game again}}}
