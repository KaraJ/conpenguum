 *
 * If you are responsible for one of these classes, please move it elsewhere
 *  and note the change (add a comment telling where the new definition is.
 * !!!You will need to add your .h and .cpp files to Server.pro!!!
 *
 * If previously compiling code starts failing to find definitions, check this
