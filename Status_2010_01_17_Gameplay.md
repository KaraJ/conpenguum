Gameplay/Phyics Team Status Report                           18/1/2010

I have scheduled a meeting or Wedsnesday the 20th in the afternoon. The items we will be discussing are as follows:

  * Number of degrees to our circle
  * Square v. Round collision detection
  * Basic movement paths (thrusting turns, reverse thrust etc...)
  * Speeds and friction
  * Bullet size (hit box of a single pixel)
  * Basic timeline for function completion
  * Other relevent items brought by during the meeting

We have informaly discussed the basics but I want my entire team to sit down and discuss how they think theses items should work. After our meeting Wedsnesday I will begin a chorespondence with Jordan from the grafics team to discuss ship sizes and the representation of the physical stats we decide upon during the meeting. Exact numbers for speed of projectiles, velocity loss after a collision and thrust will be decided after sufficient data has been gathered from a few simple tests. These tests will require a basic understanding of QT. Some members of my team will be instructed to learn the basics of QT and write one of the tests. I will compile the data gathered and upload it to the project.
